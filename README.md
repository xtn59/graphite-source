# graphite-source
graphite, a music player made in python.
made by xtn

this is a project mostly made for linux. there is some windows support i tried to make, but it won't be the best music player experience you will witness.
i am still a begginer learning, i WILL optimize the code and add icons instead of the flat text.

Download your  graphite version, run it once, navigate to either "/home/username/.config/graphite-app/", download the logo's, put them inside the folder, now graphite will work.
graphite_linux.py now prints song names to a file called song.txt in your graphite-app folder. you can use it for practically anything, scripts, waybar modules, whatever you desire.

WINDOWS GRAPHITE VERSION IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE. I will focus on unix based systems for now.
